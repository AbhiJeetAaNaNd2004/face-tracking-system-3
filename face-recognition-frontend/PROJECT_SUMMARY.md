```

### Backend Integration
The frontend integrates with the existing FastAPI backend through:
- **REST API Endpoints**: `/auth/login/`, `/employees/`, `/attendance/`, `/stream/`
- **HTTP Streaming**: For real-time camera feeds
- **JWT Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization headers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and user feedback

## 🎛️ Features Walkthrough
